			C# and .NET Framework Differences
Microsoft’s implementation of C# is heavily integrated with the .NET Framework so it is understandable that the two concepts would be confused. .Net isn’t just a library, but also a runtime for executing applications. C# is a programming language, .NET is a blanket term that tends to cover both the .NET Framework and the Common Language Runtime which is the runtime in which .NET assemblies are run.
